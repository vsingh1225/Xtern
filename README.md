Due to there being difficulties displaying plotly graphs in the notebook and in nbviewer, I exported them as HTML files and am including them on here in a zip file.
Please download them and refer to them, as I draw most of my conclusions from there.

Thank you so much, and have a good day!

# Conclusions (Also in Notebook):
From the graphs shown in the HTML files and the the way they are organized, the best places for consumers to order from are data points that are colored more darkly, and are preferably larger (and more noticeable), as those would imply the restaurant is reliable and efficient. From that criteria, we can derive the following: 
NOTE: Key for file names
chinese.html - chinese restaurants only
indian.html - indian restaurants only
other.html - all other restaurants
new_set.html - restaurants with no ratings
main_set.html - all restaurants
1. People tend to order from places that sell Chinese food the most, and although cook times wildly varied, there seemed to be a preference for that cuisine. This was followed by "other" cuisine, meaning neither chinese nor indian, and then indian, and was measured by the amount of reviews left.
2. Indian food takes the longest to prepare and cook, evident by the number of data points that are colored to the end of the spectrum that shows a higher cooking time. On the flip side, "other" cuisine seemed to take the least amount of time to prepare.
3. Geographical location does not seem to have an effect on how many people ordered from a place, although there are certain locations on graphs that do seem to correlate with a spike in popularity. For example, in the graph for chinese restaurants, a latitude of ~39.75 and Longitude of -84.4-(-84.6) seemed to be a hotspot for relatively popular restaurants. However, a vast majority of the areas in others show almost no correlation. This means that from this data, restaruants have no locational advantage.
4. There is (surprisingly) not a very strong correlation between the time to cook, number of reviews, and the average rating (shown in the hover data). If there is a very high cooking time, then there is always an above average amount of reviews, and tends to be on the lower side (below 4.5). Those that are darker colored (meaning lower cooking time), and have a large amount of reviews, on the other hand, tend to have a mix of ratings, however, ranging from below 4, all the way to above 4.5.
